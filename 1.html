<h3> Life is a privilege for some and struggle for others.It is imperative that we open our hearts and minds to the people in need of financial support.There will always be an initiative that drives us the most be it education for all,health for all,food for all or more.
Also,we are overwhelmed by events around us,be it natural calamities,terror attacks,climatic problems,farmers' problems,etc. 
Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.
